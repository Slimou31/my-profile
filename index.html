      <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Salma Tazi, a student at HEC Paris whoâ€™s as curious about coding as I am about the world around me. Working in private equity gives me a front-row seat to how global business evolvesâ€”especially as the internet transforms how we learn, connect, and collaborate. Between crunching numbers and exploring new digital tools, youâ€™ll find me indulging my passions: traveling to discover fresh perspectives, following the high-speed drama of Formula 1, and letting loose through dance. Iâ€™m here to learn, experiment, and create something meaningful with each new line of code.</p>

        <h2>My Passion: Dance</h2>
        <p>It lies in blending contemporary and classical dance. Each movement offers a chance to express emotions, tell stories, and connect with othersâ€”constantly challenging me to evolve, refine, and rediscover myself through the art of movement.</p>

        <h2>Hobby: Traveling and Photography</h2>
        <p>I enjoy traveling to unfamiliar places and capturing their essence through photographyâ€”playing with light, composition, and perspective to tell stories of the people, cultures, and moments I encounter along the way.</p>

        <h2>Project: Dog Shelter in Morocco</h2>
        <p>I'm currently working on establishing a shelter to protect stray dogs from a recent law that allows authorities to euthanize them. Together with my dad, Iâ€™ve already started the shelter in Casablanca, and Iâ€™m determined to expand this safe haven beyond my home city. Itâ€™s still a work in progress, but Iâ€™m excited about the potential impact we can make for these animals.</p>
